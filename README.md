# ***IPO-Inclined-Planes-system-Optimization-Algorithm***
** Full description:
A new optimization method based on the dynamic of sliding motion along a frictionless inclined plane. In IPO, a collection of agents cooperate with each other and move toward better positions in the search space by employing Newtonâ€™s second law and equations of motion. The standard version of the IPO is presented by Mozafari et al. in 2016. Powerful improved versions of it called MIPO and SIPO along with its multi-objective version of MOIPO were presented in 2016, 2017 and 2019 by Dr. Ali Mohammadi (myself) and colleagues at the University of Birjand, respectively. This powerful algorithm has also been used in many applications, which has provided very good outputs. In the following, the standard version of the IPO algorithm along with the benchmark functions reviewed in its reference article, and its improved versions are attached.**


***Notes:

1- In the appendix, all the source code files of each algorithm are included along with its reference article.

2- The standard version is included with the benchmark functions.

3- Modified versions also comes with some benchmark functions.

4- To use them, reading the reference article will easily remove all ambiguities.

5- Citation with reference articles is required if any version is used.

6- In case of any questions or ambiguities, please contact the author of the article via email; Or call me.
